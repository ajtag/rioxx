The RIOXX Metadata Application Profile provides a mechanism to help institutional repositories comply with the [RCUK policy on open access](http://www.rcuk.ac.uk/research/openaccess/policy/). RIOXX focuses on applying consistency to the metadata fields used to record research funder and project/grant identifiers and is designed to support the consistent tracking of open-access research publications across scholarly systems.



## History

The RIOXX metadata application profile was developed by Paul Walk (while at [UKOLN][2]) and then [EDINA][1]) and by Sheridan Brown (Chygrove Ltd), working closely with [RCUK][3] who acted as sponsor and in collaboration with [HEFCE][4] who supported and endorse this work. This work was previously funded and supported by [Jisc][5].
